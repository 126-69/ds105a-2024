# What do I know?

This repository contains my self-reflection notes on everything I've learned in the [DS105A (2024/25) course](https://lse-dsi.github.io/2024/autumn-term) so far.

## What you will find here

Here you will find my notes on the following topics:

- Operating Systems and file systems
- Terminal shells (e.g. the `bash` shell on Linux)
- The different data file formats
- Python essentials (with some code demonstrations)
- Python tricks for dealing with files
- Text formatting using Markdown
- Jupyter Notebooks

and more!

\#TODO: Shorten or expand on the topics above as needed and add links to the Notebook(s) throughout.

## How I used AI in this revision

\#TODO: If I end up using an AI tool for this, I will explain how I did it here or add a link to a separate `.md` file or Jupyter Notebook where I explain it.
